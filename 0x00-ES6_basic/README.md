# ES6 Features Implementation

This repository demonstrates various ES6 features applied to solve small problems. Each solution incorporates modern JavaScript syntax for cleaner, more efficient code. Below is a summary of the key tasks completed:

1. **Block Scope**: Refactored variable declarations to use `let` and `const` to avoid variable overwriting inside blocks.
2. **Arrow Functions**: Converted a standard function to an anonymous arrow function.
3. **Parameter Defaults**: Simplified function parameters by using default values.
4. **Rest Parameter**: Modified a function to count the number of arguments using the rest parameter syntax.
5. **Spread Syntax**: Concatenated arrays and strings using the spread operator.
6. **Template Literals**: Replaced string concatenation with template literals for better readability.
7. **Object Property Shorthand**: Simplified object property definitions using shorthand syntax.
8. **Computed Property Names**: Used computed property names to dynamically create object properties.
9. **ES6 Method Properties**: Refactored object methods to use ES6 method property shorthand.
10. **For...of Loops**: Replaced `for...in` with `for...of` loop for iterating through arrays.
11. **Iterator**: Created a function to return an object mapping department names to employee lists.
12. **Report Object**: Implemented a report object containing employee data with a method to return the number of departments.

Each task emphasizes modern JavaScript practices to improve readability and functionality.
